Let's pretend we're adults and do adult things today!\"\n3. \"Wakey, wakey! Eggs and bakey… or just coffee. Who needs food when you have caffeine?\"\n4. \"Good morning! May your coffee be strong and your Monday be short!\"\n5. \"Rise and shine! It’s time to pretend we know what we’re doing!\"\n6. \"Good morning! Time to go make some memories—hopefully good ones this time!\"\n7. \"Morning! I hope your day is as fabulous as your bed was comfortable!\"\n8. \"Good morning! May your day be more productive than my attempts to get out of bed!\"\n9. \"Good morning! Let’s get this day started before it figures out it’s a Monday!\"\n10. \"Good morning! Time to show the world who’s boss… just as soon as I find my coffee.\"\n\nFeel free to use any of these to bring a smile to someone's face!"
